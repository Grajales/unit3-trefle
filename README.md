Get started with our eBird Essentials
Bird Essentials
The Explore Data tab is a good place to begin. Range maps show where species are found, bar charts show migration timing, and you can even sign up for Alerts to learn about interesting birds as soon as they are reported. The Explore a Location tool provides a dashboard style overview of all the eBird activity in a region. From here there are links to bar charts, recent sightings, and the best local birding hotspots.

Bird Observations
All bird observations are valuable, and every sighting--no matter how common the species--is important for understanding where and when birds occur around the globe. Your observations appear with others from the eBird community on eBirdâ€™s maps and graphs. Researchers download these data, and their scientific findings are used to make more informed conservation decisions. See eBird Science Use for more information.
